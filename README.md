Reweighing-CPMD-TASS

# Brief Description

Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling (TASS) method combines the temperature accelerated molecular dynamics with umbrella sampling and
metadynamics to sample the collective variable space in an efficient manner. \

This Modular Fortran program unbias the Probability of TASS output generated in CPMD/PLUMED run, which can be used to compute multidimensional (1D/2D) free energy via WHAM reweighting. It can also directly generate 1D free energy using Mean Force method (MF). \
1D and 2D Basis Spline interpolation can be performed to find intermediate points in free energy .

+ UPDATE    :: "Reweight Biased Simulation from both CPMD and PLUMED Packages."
+ IMPORTANT :: ALL THE ARGUMENTS IN THE RUN FILE ARE CASE SENSITIVE.
+ COLVAR file must have the format of CV1_ext CV2_ext CV3_ext ....
- !! PERIODICITY IS NOT YET IMPLIMENTED !!

How to Run -->
"-------------"
A bash script is given along with the program (run_tass.sh) 
Create execute permission by following command :
chomd 755 run_tass.sh
To compute Free Energy using Mean Force method =-> -tool pmf   (case sensitive)
To compute multidimensional probabilities      =-> -tool probT (case sensitive)
